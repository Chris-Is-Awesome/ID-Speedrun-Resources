### Rules

Trigger credits after completing all dungeons (including Dream World, excluding Promised Remedy).

The dungeon must be marked as complete (with a checkmark on map) for it to be counted, this often requires you to open the chest that spawns after the boss, or in Dream World, you enter the final room of the dungeon. In Grand Library, you have to open the raft chest, but can skip the Forbidden Key chest.
